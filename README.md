Simply search for packages in bower DB ...

* Why a non official version to search into the registry ?

  well, if you look at the official registry at [http://bower.io/search/](http://bower.io/search/)
  you'll realize that:
  
  1) it doesn't work in real time .. actually you have to wait a long time before changes in the registry appear there
  
  2) it filters out a lot of entries probably only duplicated but I guess there are more filtered out
  
  so right now it says there are 
  
  '40758 matched results. Showing page 1 of 1359. '
  
  while the register contains 53.480 entries ...
  
  and finally the results shon as per page is really annoyng (at least to me)
  

try it on <h3> [EC2](http://www.aws0me.tk/search/).. or .. on [Heroku](https://bower-search.herokuapp.com/search/).. or .. on [Azure](http://bower-search.azurewebsites.net/search/).. or .. on [ScalingGo](https://bower-search.scalingo.io/search/)..
